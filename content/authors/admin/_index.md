    summary: |
      I explored the principles behind generative models. By the end of the course, I was able to build and train a U-Net to generate images from pure noise, enhance image quality using the denoising diffusion process, and incorporate context embeddings to control image outputs. Additionally, I could generate images from English text prompts by leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) neural network, bridging the gap between visual and linguistic representations.

I am an ninth-semester Systems Engineering student at Universidad Industrial de Santander, passionate about Deep Learning and Computer Vision convinced that AI has a huge potential to positively transform people‚Äôs lives. I am currently working on thermal imaging projects, focusing on range, emissivity, and temperature estimation. Furthermore, I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence research, and I am dedicated to advancing my work in this field through focused research initiatives.
