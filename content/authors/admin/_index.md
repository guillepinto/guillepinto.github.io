      Figure out how to do supervised training with a dataset without labels and then I ended up learning how to do 3D to 2D registration to get some labels using CloudCompare for passive monocular depth estimation with hyperspectral long-wave imagery.

awards:
  - title: Fundamentals of Deep Learning

    summary: |
      I learned how deep learning works through hands-on exercises in computer vision and natural language processing. I trained deep learning models from scratch, mastering tools and techniques to achieve highly accurate results in tasks such as image recognition and language translation. Additionally, I gained experience leveraging state-of-the-art pre-trained models to save time and accelerate deep learning applications. The workshop taught me how multi-layered artificial neural networks can recognize complex patterns in data that are too subtle for traditional expert-written software.
  - title: Generative AI with Diffusion Models

    summary: |
      I explored the principles behind generative models. By the end of the course, I was able to build and train a U-Net to generate images from pure noise, enhance image quality using the denoising diffusion process, and incorporate context embeddings to control image outputs. Additionally, I could generate images from English text prompts by leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) neural network, bridging the gap between visual and linguistic representations.

      Learned:
      - How networks function, including data transmission and cabling types
      - IP addressing, Internet data routing, and transport layer operations
      - Built a home wireless network and completed 13 Packet Tracer activities
